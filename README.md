## What are Codas? 

Codas are Markdown texts that provide a clear and concise way to document data structures. Each Coda can automatically generate efficient binary codecs and APIs tailored for various programming languages. This approach streamlines the development process and enhances data interchange.

## Features

- **Markdown-Based**: Simple and readable documentation format.
- **Automatic Code Generation**: Generate codecs and APIs for multiple platforms with ease.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Support for asynchronous data handling.
- **Lock-Free Mechanism**: Enhanced performance in concurrent environments.
- **Protocol Buffers Support**: Seamless integration with existing data serialization standards.
- **Ring Buffer Implementation**: Efficient data handling for streaming applications.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with TypeScript, Python, Rust, and more.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install Codas, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/gio-barbosa/codas/releases). Once downloaded, follow the instructions in the documentation to set it up on your machine.

### Usage

After installation, you can create your first Coda by following these steps:

1. **Create a Markdown File**: Define your data structure using Markdown syntax.
2. **Generate Code**: Use the Codas command-line tool to generate codecs and APIs.
3. **Integrate**: Use the generated code in your application.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a Coda Markdown file:

```markdown
# User

## Fields
- `id`: Integer
- `name`: String
- `email`: String
```

Run the Codas tool to generate the necessary code for your platform.

## Supported Platforms

Codas currently supports the following platforms:

- **TypeScript**: Generate TypeScript interfaces and classes.
- **Python**: Create Python classes for data manipulation.
- **Rust**: Generate Rust structs and implementations.

Future updates will expand support to additional platforms based on community feedback.
